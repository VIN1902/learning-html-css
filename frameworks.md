# Why HTML/CSS Frameworks are Necessary

-   **Faster development & iteration**

    -   The main goal of a real-world product is to ship quickly and improve based on user feedback.
    -   Frameworks provide pre-built, tested, and standardized components (buttons, navbars, modals, forms, etc.) that save time.

-   **Handling hidden complexity**

    -   Many UI features seem simple at first (tables, forms, grids, responsive layouts, pop-ups) but quickly become complex to implement and maintain.
    -   Frameworks abstract away browser quirks, cross-device compatibility, and accessibility concerns.

-   **Consistency & maintainability**

    -   Frameworks enforce design consistency across the project through standardized styles, spacing, and components.
    -   Teams can work faster and avoid reinventing the wheel for common UI elements.

-   **Specialized solutions**

    -   Different frameworks are optimized for different needs:
        -   **Bootstrap / Foundation** -> general-purpose, responsive, grid-based UI.
        -   **Tailwind CSS** -> utility-first, rapid customization.
        -   **Materialize / MUI** -> design language implementation (Material Design).
    -   Choosing the right framework lets developers solve specific UI/UX challenges in-depth without starting from scratch.

-   **Community & ecosystem**
    -   Frameworks are backed by large communities that maintain, update, and expand them.
    -   Documentation, plugins, and best practices are readily available, reducing learning curves.

# When _Not_ to Use Frameworks

-   **Small / simple projects**

    -   If the project is just a static page, a landing page, or a small feature, adding a full framework may be overkill.
    -   Vanilla HTML/CSS (with maybe a light reset stylesheet) is often enough.

-   **Learning fundamentals**

    -   Beginners should avoid frameworks initially. Relying too much on them can block understanding of raw HTML, CSS, and responsive design concepts.
    - If one understands the core concepts of html/css than that helps them even more while using framework because they can see and tweak the css written/generated by frameworks themselves.

# Some contemporary framework
1. Shoelace - accessibility, feature control.
2. Bootstrap - quick components, easy to integrate/learn.
3. Radix, React Aria - accessibility.
4. Shadcn - components on top of base of radix.
5. DaisyUI - '_tailwind's bootstrap_', gives abstraction over class pollution of tailwind.
6. MUI
7. TanStack
8. Tailwind
9. Ant Design
