    <h1>Adding videos and audios to page</h1>
    <p>For adding media from other webpages like youtube use iframe not these elements. This is when your media is at same server where your html file is stored.</p>
    <p>In this examples the html file and media files are all stored on local-machine so we use these media tags. Just like in case of server.</p>
    <p>Track element is the child for both media elements. <br/> Specify a timed text track (or time-based data) that can be displayed in parallel with the media element. <br/> In .vtt format - web video text tracks. Subtitle is default for kind attribute (caption, description, etc). <br/> URL value of src attribute must have the same origin as the document.</p>
    <p>Inside video or audio tag you can also add text as fallback in case media doesn't load.</p>

    <p>For HTML APIs (geo location, canvas, drag and drop), JS is needed pure html is not enough and better yet use frameworks or libraries.</p>
