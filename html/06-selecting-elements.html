    <h1 id="main-heading">Global attributes: Class and Id</h1>
    <p class="imp">The purpose/point of classes and ids is to <em>target and select</em> elements. Styling after selection is only one usecase.</p>
    <p>Targeting elements is usefull in many frameworks for styling or for other tasks.</p>
    <p class="imp">In JS the convention is to use Ids for targeting only unique elements and if more unique elements show-up then produce more ids. This way page only has few ids and lots of classes.</p>
    <p>But in CSS convention almost all frameworks produce only classes.</p>
    <p class="imp">In self-written code best practice is to use only one id per web-page and rest classes. But frameworks work with different approach and they <em>programaticaly generate</em> ids & classes instead of hard-writing them.</p>
