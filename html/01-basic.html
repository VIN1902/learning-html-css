    <h1>HTML</h1>
    <p>Use index.html as file name if you want that to be recognized as entry point by different s/w, also its the standard.</p>
    <p>Emmet is s/w that provides functionality to write fast html and css. vscode has it pre-configured. provides abbreviation for boilerplate too.</p>
    <p>Read mdn documentation for filling gaps in knowledge.</p>
    <p>HTML is a structure language before hypertext or anything. The point is to provide structure to web page. Others like markdown do that too but HTML is most supported universally. Everthing has a browser by default thesedays.</p>
    <p>Heading tags are not just font-sizes, they provide relevance to page structure by assigning importance to content, not only to reader but to search-engines.</p>
    <p>Tag is the smallest unit, Element is opening tag (along with attribute plus its value) + content + closing tag.</p>
    <p>For tags its recommended that you provide some closing, either proper closing tag or self-closing. If not then browser won't give errors but certain frameworks like React might.</p>
    <br /> <!-- Good practice to write it as a self-closing tag instead of just open -->
    <p>HTML is not case-sensitive, no need to write tag capital.</p>
    <h1>Nested <span>element</span></h1>
    <p>Elements can be nested with other elements inside them. like using span tag in heading above.</p>
    <p>'#' value to attributes like href in anchor tag means 'stay at current page and scroll to the top'. '#' is fragment identifier pointing to top of current page. Use it as </p>
    <ul>
        <li>A 'scroll to top' link. <a href="#">Click here to go at top</a></li>
        <li>Just a <i>temporary placeholder</i> for actual links cause it will either reload or scroll to top of page, which is often unwanted.</li>
        <li>To jump to any element on current page by specifying its id. ex: href = '#someId'</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Some attributes are required for a tag others are optional. like title attribute is optional, it provides a small section when hovered over an element.</p>
